# 👋 Hello!

## 🚀 About Me

I’m an Artificial Intelligence engineering student at **ENIB** (École Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest), passionate about **speech synthesis**, **signal processing**, **computer vision**, and building **offline intelligent systems**.

In my free time, I design and develop **fully local voice assistants**, **machine learning applications for voice**, and innovative projects at the intersection of **cybersecurity**, **computer vision**, and **AI-generated content detection** (like **deepfake audio**).

I specialize in creating **privacy-focused local voice solutions** and explore open-source LLMs like **GPT4All**, **Nous Hermes**, and **Mistral**. I also enjoy working with tools like **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **OpenCV** to build **real-time AI-powered interfaces**.

### 🌍 Interests

- 💻 **AI & Machine Learning**: Real-time models, voice AI, local-first systems  
- 🎤 **Speech Synthesis**: Custom voice assistants, voice-to-voice pipelines  
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: Fatigue detection, facial analysis, eye tracking  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**: Deepfake detection, audio anti-spoofing
