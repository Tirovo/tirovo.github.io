👋 Hello!


I’m an Artificial Intelligence engineering student at **ENIB** (École Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest), passionate about **signal processing**, **computer vision**, and building **intelligent systems**.

In my free time, I design and develop projects in various fields that interest me (AI, Data Science, software Engineering,...)

For example I have created  **a fatigue detector (FatiguEye)** and **AI powered application that recognizes emotions in the human speech (EmotionAI-Voice)**. I am currently developping **an AI local assistant (Numa)** and **a reverse engineering AI tool for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) (BoardMapper) with Florian Pasco**.

On my GitHub you will find various projects using various technologies, probably mostly **Data Science and Machine Learning** but not only , as I am curious by nature and **always looking forward to learning new technologies and acquiring new skills**.


🌍 Interests

- 💻 **AI & Machine Learning**: Real-time models, voice AI, local-first systems  
- 🎤 **Speech Synthesis**: Custom voice assistants, voice-to-voice pipelines  
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: Fatigue detection, facial analysis, eye tracking  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**: Deepfake detection, audio anti-spoofing
- And a lot more !
