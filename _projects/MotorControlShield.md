The **Motor Control Shield** is an open-source project designed for controlling DC motors. It comes in the form of an Arduino shield mounted on an STM32 Nucleo board. The shield enables motor control via an NMOS transistor, current measurement with a shunt resistor, and rotation tracking using data from an incremental encoder.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🔄 **Motor Control**: Provides precise control over DC motors.
- 📉 **Current Measurement**: Monitors the current consumed by the motor.
- 🔄 **Rotation Tracking**: Uses an incremental encoder to track motor rotation.
- 🛠️ **Open-source & Customizable**: Modifiable and adaptable for various projects.
