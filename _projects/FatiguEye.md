A smart computer vision system that detects signs of fatigue, eye strain, and microsleep using a standard webcam.

---

## 🎯 Purpose


**FatiguEye** is a real-time fatigue detection system based on eye tracking and facial landmark analysis.  
It helps identify early signs of drowsiness by measuring:
- 👁️ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- 🔁 Blink frequency
- ⏱️ Prolonged eyelid closure
- ⚠️ Microsleep events

Ideal for driver monitoring, industrial safety, or ergonomic fatigue prevention.

## 🧠 How It Works


FatiguEye uses [MediaPipe Face Mesh](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to extract eye landmarks, and computes the **EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)** on each video frame.

### 📡 Processing pipeline:


1. 🎥 Webcam feed is captured in real-time
2. 🧠 Facial landmarks (eyes) are detected with Mediapipe
3. 📏 EAR is calculated per eye
4. 🧮 Blink count and eye closure duration are analyzed
5. 🔔 Fatigue alerts are raised (visual + audio)
